#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) algorithm would be O(n). 1 loop and runtime is  equal to n so if n = 3 it will loop 3 times then terminate 


b)O(n^2) algorithm would be better as O(n log n)(base 2) this is for while looping so every input ^2 larger inputs take much longer runtimes


c)algorithm would be O(n) recursion? the loops are dependent upon the amount of bunnyEars
